# Tinker Log

My personal blog. Built on Rails, Postgres, Docker and duct tape.

## Installing locally

When first pulling down you'll need to install the dependencies in the host OS.

Run the following script after first cloning the project:

```sh
./scripts/setup-local.sh
```

## Building the production images

Run the following script:

```sh
./scripts/build-prod.sh
```

## Running the production image

Run the following script:

```sh
./scripts/run-prod.sh
```

## More information

The read me that explains how the rails app works is in the Rails folder. This dockerization is a work in progress.
