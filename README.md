# README

This is a personal blog that I'm building with Rails to force myself to learn Ruby and the Rails framework. I'm a big fan of Hugo's workflow for editing blogs as version-controllable static files, so I'm trying to build a similar structure and this probably looks nothing like a Rails app. It's just for learning though, and I get to learn more than I ever wanted to know about deploying Ruby to a server.

To import the blog posts into the SQLite database, run the following commmand:
```
rake posts:import
```

TODO: ADD THE FOLLOWING:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
